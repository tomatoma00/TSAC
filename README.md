# TSAC
Mismatching Removal for Feature Point Matching based on Triangular Topology Probability Sampling Consensus

You can run our method from start.py. To present our method in detail, we display the images of intermediate process, so the execution time does not indicate the real execution time of the algorithm. 

The configuration required to run this method is Python 3.9.5 and openCV 4.5.3.
